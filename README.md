# CNAD Assignment 1

## Design Consideration of Your Microservices

The microservices in this project are designed using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

1. **Model**  
   - Represents the data and business logic for each microservice.  
   - Handles database interactions, such as queries, inserts, updates, and validations.  
   - Each microservice has its own dedicated database and model layer to ensure service isolation.

2. **View**  
   - Not applicable in this backend-focused project as no UI components are included.  
   - The API responses generated by the controllers serve as the "views," providing JSON or other structured data to the clients.

3. **Controller**  
   - Acts as the intermediary between the Model and the external API requests.  
   - Handles all incoming HTTP requests via endpoints exposed by the API Gateway.  
   - Processes the requests, interacts with the Model layer for data operations, and returns the appropriate response to the clients.

### Why MVC Was Chosen
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divides the system into distinct layers, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain each microservice independently.
- **Scalability**: The decoupled nature of the MVC design allows for scaling specific components without affecting others.
- **Readability and Organization**: Ensures the codebase remains structured and easy to navigate, especially with multiple microservices.
- **Flexibility**: Changes to the business logic (Model) or the API endpoints (Controller) can be made independently.

By following the MVC pattern, the project achieves a modular design where each component of a microservice is responsible for a specific role, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling across the system.

## Architecture Diagram Design

In the architecture design:

1. **Load Balancer**  
   - Manages incoming traffic to ensure high availability and reliability.

2. **API Gateway**  
   - Acts as the single entry point for all user requests.  
   - Routes requests to the appropriate microservices based on the API endpoint, ensuring effective load distribution and enhanced security.

3. **Microservices on Amazon EC2**  
   - All microservices are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances with auto-scaling enabled.  
   - Auto-scaling ensures new instances are created dynamically during traffic spikes or server failures, maintaining system availability and performance.

4. **Service Isolation**  
   - Each service operates independently with its own dedicated microservice and database.  
   - This design ensures that a failure in one service does not impact the functionality of others, promoting robust system resilience.

## Instructions for Setting Up and Running Microservices

Follow these steps to set up and run your microservices:

1. **Database Setup**  
   - Import the database files (`billing_db.sql`, `reservation_db.sql`, `user_db.sql`, `vehicle_db.sql`) into **MySQL Workbench**.

2. **Update Database Credentials**  
   - Modify the database connection credentials in the following files:
     - **`billing_db.go`** (located in `assignment1/services/billing/utils`)
     - **`reservation_db.go`** (located in `assignment1/services/reservation/utils`)
     - **`db.go`** (located in `assignment1/services/user/utils`)
     - **`vehicle_db.go`** (located in `assignment1/services/vehicle/utils`)
   - Example modification:
     ```go
     db, err = sql.Open("mysql", "root:04D685362v98@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/billing_db")
     ```

3. **Update Main Service Endpoint**  
   - In `main.go`, change the URL for the localhost (`localhost:8080`) to your specific localhost URL.


4. **Ensure Dependencies in `go.mod`**  
   - Make sure the following dependencies are included in your `go.mod` file:
     ```go
     module assignment1

     go 1.23.1

     require (
         filippo.io/edwards25519 v1.1.0 // indirect
         github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.8.1 // indirect
         github.com/gorilla/mux v1.8.1 // indirect
         github.com/gorilla/securecookie v1.1.2 // indirect
         github.com/gorilla/sessions v1.4.0 // indirect
         golang.org/x/crypto v0.29.0 // indirect
     )
